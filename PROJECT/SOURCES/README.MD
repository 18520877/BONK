# Notes:
## This implementation has been merged into the keras.applications module!

## Install the latest version Keras on GitHub and import it with: 

``` 
from keras.applications.inception_resnet_v2 import InceptionResNetV2, preprocess_input
```

## If you have trouble with keras.application obtain_input_shape method, try:
Replace ```keras.application``` with ```keras_application```
